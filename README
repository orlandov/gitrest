This is a simple WSGI application that provides a restful interface to Git.
Eventually I'd like it to have a full web2.0 ajaxy interface. Until then, REST
and json will do.

Provides the following resources:

Repos
------

/repos
/repos/:repo_id

Branches
--------

/repos/:repo_id/branches
/repos/:repo_id/branches/:branch_id

Commits
-------

/repos/:repo_id/commits
/repos/:repo_id/branches/:branch_id/commits
